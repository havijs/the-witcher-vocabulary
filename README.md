# The Witcher book series vocabulary
---
This repo contains the meaning of some of the new words (for me) in each chapter of the books. So you can take a look at the words before you start reading the chapter.  
I'll add new words while I'm reading each chapter.  
I mostly use [Longman Dictionary](https://www.ldoceonline.com/) to find the meaning of new words.
